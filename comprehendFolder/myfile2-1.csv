One hundred thirteen children representing eighty-nine families are served by Urban Sprouts. While at Urban Sprouts, each child can feel known and included, to know that his or her presence contributes fundamentally to the Urban Sprouts school community. Children can feel safe and encouraged to explore not only materials, but also their relationships with peers and adults. They feel important and valued when others listen to them, seek out their ideas, and allow them to express themselves. When students feel safe, cared for, and valued they take healthy risks required to tackle those tasks that strengthen their cognitive abilities as well as their social and physical abilities. Infants and toddlers need food and drink throughout the day to support their emotional, social, and physical well-being. A child who is thirsty or hungry cannot interact successfully with other children or adults. Breakfast and lunch are prepared from scratch every day using locally sourced, seasonal ingredients.

All costs, including air fare, lodging and meals are paid by FMF. To date, FMF has served over 700 warriors.Upon leaving the military, many warriors, especially those suffering physical wounds or the emotional wounds of PTS/TBI, experience depression and a lack of direction which can lead to confusion, despair and, tragically, suicide. These symptoms can persist over years if not properly addressed. During the week at FOCUS, participants are given the tools to build rewarding and meaningful lives. The program starts with an intense, introspective, 3-day workshop to recognize and purge negative tendencies and to embrace and overcome the difficulties of civilian life. Superb motivational speakers inspire participants to rise above their challenges, reject victimization, adopt positive habits, and recognize their inherent potential. Participants are coached in practical life skills such as networking, resume writing, mock interviews and other important talents. During the week, participants experience renewed hope and direction, develop positive characteristics, experience enhanced self-worth, and are re-committed to themselves and their families and friends.

Q320,"Junior Achievement (JA) programs help prepare young people for the real world by showing them how to generate wealth and effectively manage it, how to create jobs which make their communities more robust, and how to apply entrepreneurial thinking to the workplace. Students put these lessons into action and learn the value of contributing to their communities. JA's elementary school programs are the foundation of its K-12 curricula. Six sequential themes, each with five hands-on activities, as well as an after-school and capstone experience, work to change students' lives by helping them understand business and economics. The middle grades programs build on concepts the students learned in Junior Achievement's elementary school program and help teens make difficult decisions about how to best prepare for their educational and professional future. The programs supplement standard social studies curricula and develop communication skills that are essential to success in the business world. As high school students begin to position themselves for their future, there are many unanswered questions about what lies ahead. Junior Achievement's high school programs help students make informed, intelligent decisions about their future, and foster skills that will be highly useful in the business world. Junior Achievement of Greater Kansas City reached more than 25,000 students in the Kansas City metropolitan area and St. Joseph, Missouri area through 1,198 classes taught by over 1,000 volunteers throughout the 2016-2017 academic year.

OATS normal hours are Monday through Friday 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m., but many times operates outside those hours due to the nature of the transportation.OATS not only is concerned about the cost of operating the vehicles, but replacement of the vehicles too. OATS raises money through over 1,000 volunteers who do fundraising and donations. OATS is normally required to match 20% of the total cost of the vehicles with cash. This can be a challenge and takes years to get funds to be able to match one vehicle in that county. OATS has found over the years ways to put aside funds to help in this capital requirement such as donations contributions, depreciation costs on contracts and state-incentive programs such as the Neighborhood Assistance Program. We have fleet plans so replacements, expansions and major repairs are laid out for the future years to keep this service going.Our long-term goal is to provide the most transportation service for the dollars received and look for other means of support to continue our mission. A quarterly newsletter along with our website provides the general public information on our services, and we make sure the required information in regard to the aspects of OATS is available to the public when required. The mission of OATS, Inc. is to provide reliable transportation for transportation disadvantaged Missourians so they can live independently in their own communities.

I60I,"PROGRAMS:Grief Seminars are held throughout the year for all law enforcement survivors across the United States. In May of each year during the National Police Survivors' Conference held in Washington, DC, during National Police Week, survivors can attend a number of different seminars on grief issues. In May of 2017, approximately 4,800 police survivors and affected coworkers registered for C.O.P.S. seminars. Debriefings, one-on-one counseling, family counseling, and crisis intervention sessions were held for the adult survivors. The children participate in their own peer-support group sessions. They work with counselors and trauma specialists to address their individual grief issues. During the summer and fall of the year, C.O.P.S. provides survivor specific retreats, known as ""Hands-On Programs"". They are Kids Summer Camp, Teens Outward Bound Experience, Young Adults Camp, Adult Children, Spouses, Parents, Sibling, Co-workers, Co-workers for Couples, Fianc/Significant Other, and Extended Family Retreats. These retreats are held at rural locations and around the country. The survivors experience self-help challenge activities as well as meeting and networking with peers who have experienced the same type of loss. All of the retreats have licensed mental health professionals that provide group and individual grief counseling for the survivors. The camps/retreats held during the summer and fall of 2017 had 1,070 survivors in attendance. Survivors return time and time again to C.O.P.S.' programs for support. The first time they attend, they say it is because the event honors their fallen officer. The second time they attend a C.O.P.S. event, they do it for their own mental well-being. After that, they come to provide support to the more newly-bereaved families. However, survivors have also returned years later when they realize issues with the death have never been emotionally resolved, the perpetrator may be coming up for parole, or another life experience has brought the horror of the death back to the forefront of their thoughts.Public Safety Agency Assistance is accomplished in a number of different ways. Each year during the winter months C.O.P.S. holds a series of training sessions titled The Traumas of Law Enforcement. These trainings educate America's law enforcement agencies about appropriate response to officer death and appropriate care for law enforcement families affected by line-of-duty death, disability, post traumatic stress disorder, and police suicide. In the 2017-18 fiscal year, these 3 day trainings were held in W. Fargo, ND; Syracuse, NY; Burlington, VT; Jacksonville, FL; Spokane, WA; Madison, MS; and McPherson, KS.C.O.P.S. contracts with leaders in the field of police trauma to conduct the sessions. The resource manual, Powerpoint presentations, and entire training have been highly praised by training participants year after year. In the 23 years that C.O.P.S. has been sponsoring these trainings, 157 sessions have been held.C.O.P.S. held its 3rd annual national Conference on Law Enforcement Wellness & Trauma. This conference had sessions with topics covering how to navigate the stresses of a law enforcement career, preparing for line-of-duty death, staying centered amidst negativity, police suicide and officer fitness and nutrition. This conference on Wellness and Trauma was well received with a total of 486 participants from across the country.C.O.P.S. also produces a semi-annual Rap Sheet newsletter for law enforcement. This newsletter is mailed to over 46,000 law enforcement officers and agencies across the United States. C.O.P.S. provides printed educational materials to law enforcement agencies and officials to help them develop a policy within their departments on handling a line-of-duty death. Some of the educational materials include topics on support at the hospital, assistance during the wake and funeral, and assistance with benefits. C.O.P.S. also continued to distribute a QuickSeries Pocket Guide that we developed for law enforcement. These small booklets are designed to provide quick reference to law enforcement departments that suffer a line of duty death. These booklets are distributed upon request from the National Office, through the C.O.P.S. Chapters and at law enforcement conferences. Members of the C.O.P.S. Board and staff regularly attend key law enforcement conferences around the country in order to educate law enforcement personnel and related organizations about the services C.O.P.S. provides to survivors and law enforcement agencies. C.O.P.S. may also offer presentations specifically designed to help them prepare to respond to a line-of-duty death. Attending these conferences also provides important inroads toward providing services to agencies and ultimately to surviving law enforcement families and co-workers.C.O.P.S. has partnered with the Public Safety Officers Benefits (PSOB) Program at the Department of Justice to train sworn and retired law enforcement officers to serve as resources to agencies filing a PSOB Death Claim following a line-of-duty death. Currently C.O.P.S. works with these PSOB Benefits Liaisons to cover every state, reaching out to all agencies experiencing a line-of-duty death. PROVIDES RESOURCES TO ASSIST IN THE REBUILDING OF THE LIVES OF SURVIVING FAMILIES AND AFFECTED CO-WORKERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY AS DETERMINED BY FEDERAL CRITIERIA.

In active pursuit of this mission, MHEC provided services in FY 17 to 47,285 inpatients, 129,491 emergency room visits, 1,334,787 outpatient visits, 9,658 Births, and 241,401 clinic visits.MHEC is a Catholic health care corporation that, pursuant to the organizational core belief that health care services are a vital and integral part of the Church's healing mission, engages in a ministry which provides general acute care, ambulatory, long-term and home care health services to individuals and families in its service communities. Consistent with the organization's commitment to social accountability and the provision of community benefit, MHEC offers other services and programs which further health promotion, maintenance and care. MHEC's services include two clinics which were established specifically for individuals who are uninsured or underinsured and do not have a means to pay for healthcare services. These clinics provide a significant focus on prenatal care. Many clinic patients were also treated, on a charitable basis, as inpatients. In response to the increased needs of the underinsured in the St. Louis area, these clinics have continually expanded, offering new services to more patients. The institution continues to focus on the provision of primary health services and education to the community, regardless of their means to pay for these services. The organization also has a continuing commitment to health research and to health education at all levels.Although reimbursement for services rendered is critical to the continued ability to provide healthcare services to all patients, MHEC recognizes that not all individuals possess the ability to purchase essential medical services and, further, that part of our mission is to provide healthcare services and healthcare education to the communities in which our facilities are located. In keeping with MHEC's commitment to serve all members of the communities it serves, MHEC provides (i) free care and/or subsidized care; (ii) care to persons covered by governmental programs at below cost; (iii) health activities and programs to support the community; (iv) health education programs; and, (v) a variety of broad community support activities. Among the community support activities offered by MHEC are the following:- Community Education Programs- Support Group Meetings- Health Fairs and Screenings- Immunizations- Smoking Cessation Programs- Indigent Care Clinics- Pre-Natal and Well Baby Care for the Indigent- Certified Application Counselors to assist community members with enrollment in qualified health plans - Health Professions Education Programs- Support of Community Programs, including active United Way participant, Healthcare for the Homeless Coalition, etc.- Financial Counseling and Discharge Counseling Services for all PatientsMHEC provides care to patients who lack financial resources and are deemed to be medically indigent. As defined by the institution's charity policy, MHEC does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify for charity care. In addition, MHEC provides services to other patients under the Medicare Program and various state Medicaid programs. Such programs pay providers amounts that are substantially less than billed charges, and frequently less than the cost, of the services provided to the recipients. Care is provided to those with limited or no ability to pay. The cost, net of any payment received (net cost), to MHEC of providing care to persons qualifying for charity or Medicaid totaled $37,010,040 in the year ended 6/30/17. Additionally, the net cost for services provided to elderly and disabled patients under the Medicare program totaled $12,567,568. These amounts do not include the cost of health activities and programs to support the community, health education programs and other community support activities. The services provided by MHEC, as well as the amount of charity care provided, demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the organization to serve in a leadership role as an advocate for responsive healthcare services for the community, with a deep commitment and sensitivity to meeting the needs of the poor.Each activity for which income is reported in column (B) of Part VIII is undertaken in furtherance of the organization's healthcare and community benefit mission described above.

Our first core program is the Ronald McDonald House, where we provide a ""home away from home"", hope and comfort for families of seriously ill and injured children receiving medical treatment in Springfield. Our two Ronald McDonald Houses have embraced 12,419 families during a time of unspeakable hardship, welcoming 903 families in 2017. The first Ronald McDonald House opened near Cox South Hospital on March 20, 1988. Our second House opened on the 6th floor of Mercy Kids on November 30, 2012. To further our Ronald McDonald House mission, staff and volunteers have proudly worked in partnership with Mercy Kids since 2010 to provide individually-packaged snacks and food items for families with children in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and Pediatric Unit. Each week, the Ronald McDonald House delivers items to each kitchen and nourishment cart to help alleviate the additional financial burden on families. In 2013 we expanded these services to include a nourishment basket in the Labor and Delivery Bereavement Room. In 2014, the Mercy Sleep Lab and NICU were added to the areas we supply with snack items. The Happy Wheels Program was launched in January 2014 for the primary purpose of ensuring that all families needing the Houses are learning about our services. In 2017, more than 2,000 care bags and snack items were provided to families and children within Cox South and Mercy departments that refer to the Ronald McDonald Houses. Our second core program is the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, a mobile dental clinic fondly known as the ""Tooth Truck"". We provide dental treatment and prevention education for at risk children, primarily in school-based settings and a qualified child is never turned away due to lack of Medicaid coverage. Throughout the process, our goal is to complete every childs treatment plan and do everything possible to increase each childs self esteem. The Tooth Truck is a joint project between RMHC of the Ozarks Inc and the Tooth Truck, Inc. and has provided 52,789 dental appointments for 23,039 children since July 8, 2002. This dental treatment is valued at $14,182,242. In 2017, the Tooth Truck provided $1.5 million in dental treatment for 1,850 children through 3,186 dental appointments. The Tooth Truck launched a daily onsite Tooth-brushing Program for early childhood education students at one school in 2011. By the end of 2017, 3,166 children were participating in the program at 19 schools and 16 nonprofit organizations. The program was formally named the Healthy Smiles Academy in 2015 and will continue to be expanded over 3 years, thanks to a grant from the Missouri Foundation for Health in late 2014.
